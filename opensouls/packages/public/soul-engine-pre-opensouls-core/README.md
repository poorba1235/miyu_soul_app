The Soul Engine
=================

The **Soul Engine** is a powerful tool for creating, developing, and deploying AI souls. Souls are dynamic, agentic, and stateful entities that are steerable by the developer, enabling the creation of engaging user and player experiences interacting with the souls.

# ⚡ QuickStart

To get started, clone our template [Soul Blueprint](https://docs.souls.chat/blueprints) to your local machine as *samantha* (or any other name!)

```bash
bunx soul-engine init samantha
```

Finally, navigate to the root directory of your cloned soul and run

```bash
cd samantha
bunx soul-engine dev
```

which will connect your soul to the engine and open the Soul Engine web interface.
