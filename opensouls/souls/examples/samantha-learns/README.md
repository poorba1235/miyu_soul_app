# Samantha learns

**Soul Designer:** [@kafischer](https://github.com/kafischer)

This soul, named Samantha, is designed to provoke the speaker and learn about them. It is modeled with a bit of an edge, and quite informal. The source code for this soul now lives in the `./soul` directory and uses the new Soul Engine layout with `soul.ts`, `memoryIntegrator.ts`, the cognitive steps used by the CLI, and a subprocess that maintains user notes for recall.

## Run this soul

In this directory run
