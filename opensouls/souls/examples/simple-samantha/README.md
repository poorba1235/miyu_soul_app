# Simple Samantha

This soul, named SamanthaSimple, is a straightforward example that demonstrates basic conversational AI. She speaks informally with gen-z slang and is designed to gain trust while learning about the user's inner world.

The soul uses a simple mental process that:
- Engages in external dialog with the user
- Reflects internally about how to better understand the user

The source code for this process can be found in the `./soul` directory.
